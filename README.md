# What I do
* I will ask a question with a certain amount of time to answer it.
* I will only show you my question until you answer it or until time runs out

  * If you answer my question correctly, I will give a pat on the back,
    but if you answer my question wrong I will be very sad but I will tell you the correct answer so you may know it for next time.

  * If you run out of time, I will let you know that you have ran out of time and then show you the correct answer

* After I get done assesing how smart you are, I will tell you how many of my questions you answered correctly and how many you just didn't know.
