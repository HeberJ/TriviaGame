  # JavaScript Assignment 2
  
  ### Overview
  
  In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.
  
  ### Submission on BCS
  
  * Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
  
  ### Before You Begin
  
  //1. Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.
  
  //2. Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
  3. Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
  
  //4. Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
  //5. Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`
  
  //* In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
  //* In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
  //* In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
  
  6. Choose a game to build from your options below. 
  
  ### Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

  **[Click Here to Watch the Demo](basic-trivia-demo.mov)**.
  
  * You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
  
  * The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
  
  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
  
  * Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
  
  * Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
  
  ### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

                **[Click Here to Watch the demo](advanced-trivia-demo.mov)**.
                
                * You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
                
                * If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
                
                * The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
                
                * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
                * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
                
                * On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
                
                ### Reminder: Submission on BCS
                
                * Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
